# 🚨 ATTENTION TIME TRAVELERS! 🕰️ DEPRECATION ALERT! 🚨

Greetings fearless developer,

Congratulations! You've stumbled upon a relic from the golden age of tech when mullets were cool, and AngularJS was the talk of the town. 🌐✨

Our dear npm package "generator-angularjs-cordova" has been gracefully ushered into retirement after 7 glorious years of service. It's like finding an ancient scroll in the coding catacombs, isn't it?

In the ever-evolving world of technology, even our digital creations must gracefully exit the stage to make room for the new rockstars. 🎸🤘

But fear not, intrepid coder! You're not alone in this journey. There are shinier, sparklier tools out there, waiting to sweep you off your feet and take you on a magical coding carpet ride. 🧞✨

So, bid farewell to our dear generator-angularjs-cordova with a tear in your eye and a smile on your face. The future is bright, my friend, and it doesn't involve dusting off relics.

May your code be bug-free and your memes be dank. Happy coding in the brave new world! 🚀💻

Bringing you a lil bit of nostalgic chuckles and a sprinkle of deprecated magic.
